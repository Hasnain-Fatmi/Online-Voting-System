<h1>Online Voting System</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  The "Online Voting System" is a transformative project poised to modernize the electoral process, providing a secure and convenient platform to exercise voting rights. This project encompasses a range of key functionalities to cater to the diverse needs of both voters and election administrators. Firstly, the system facilitates user registration, enabling eligible voters to create authenticated accounts. Simultaneously, candidates can register their candidacy, providing comprehensive profiles to inform voters of their background and platform. An integral component of the system is the Admin Dashboard, a centralized hub where election officials can oversee and manage the entire voting process. This includes overseeing ballot creation, a pivotal feature that allows administrators to customize digital ballots according to specific electoral requirements.
</p>
<p>
  Real-time monitoring and result tabulation enhance transparency, providing instant updates on the progress of the election. Additionally, the system incorporates a feedback and complaints mechanism, allowing voters to voice concerns and provide valuable insights for further improvement.
</p>
<p>
  Post-election, the system provides valuable data and insights for stakeholders to evaluate the outcome. Moreover, the ability to download election results in PDF format ensures accessibility and archival of critical election data. Incorporating these functionalities, the Online Voting System transcends traditional voting methods, offering a dynamic and secure alternative.
